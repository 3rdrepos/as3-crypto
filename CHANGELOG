CHANGELOG

v1.3a
- Fixed AESKey's static initializer
- Removed all warnings related to missing semi-colons and unused imports
- Removed tool/IDE-specific files
- Removed demo files
- Added LICENSE & CHANGELOG
- Added test-harness which logs to Flash output

v1.3
- TLS: partial TLS 1.0 support (RSA only), with TLSSocket and STARTTLS support.
- cert: Basic X509 (v1 and v2) Certificate parsing and validation
- cert: Builtin Root CAs, ripped from Mozilla. (see MozillaRootCertificates.as)
- DER: bug fix in parsing of UTCTime
- DER: limited support for outputing ASN-1 structures as DER (as little as needed for X509 cert. signing to work.)
- RSA: support for RSA signing/verifying (needed for TLS cert validation)
- hash: MD5 and MD2 classes no longer alter their source data
- secret key: RC4 doesn't reset its state before every encrypt/decrypt operation anymore. If you need that behavior, you need to use .init(key) before each call.

v1.2
- math: Completed BigInteger support. Moved BigInteger under com.hurlant.math
- public key: RSA decrypt and key generation
- crud: basic DER/PEM support to parse RSA keys (X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo and PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey)
- random: support for TLS-PRF; weak attempt at seeding Random.
- hash: added MD2. slow legacy stuff.
- modes: CFB, CFB8 and OFB padding bug fixes
- secret key: TripeDES bug fix

v1.1
- secret key: DES, 3DES, BlowFish
- mode: CTR, SimpleIV
- added toString() to each algorithm
- added dispose() to each algorithm. dispose() attempts to clear keys and states from the memory, but it is not guaranteed to work.

v1.0 (Initial release)
- public key: RSA encrypt
- secret key: AES, XTEA, RC4
- hash: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256
- HMAC
- modes: ECB, CBC, CFB, CFB8, OFB
- converters: Base64, Hex
